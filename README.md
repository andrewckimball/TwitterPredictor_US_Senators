# Machine Learning Project - Predicting Twitter Authors

As part of my final project for my Intro to Machine Learning course, my team and I set out to build a model that was trained to recognize the unique 
style of twitter authors. 
We decided specifically to analyze the twitter style of all 100 United States Senators. Our initial goal was to find the feasibility of using machine learning models to predict authors of tweets and determine a good model for the task. We chose an initial data set that would empha- size recognizing author style over simply recogniz- ing topics. We did this by looking at the most recent 500 tweets from all 100 US Senators, as they would write on similar subjects. We created three data sets with different levels of feature creation and reduc- tion that resulted in varying degrees of accuracy.
